When I think back to the concepts that first drew me to biochemistry and biophysics, it begins with chemical bonds. Atoms sharing or exchanging electrons — a seemingly simple concept — gives rise to complex geometries, spatial arrangements, and chemistries. These patterns form the foundation of the macromolecules and cellular pathways I’ve worked with every day.

I often find myself returning to the core principles of organic and physical chemistry to make sense of the scientific literature I’m reading and topics I'm thinking about. In doing so, I’ve felt a growing urge to share more questions, more ideas, and more independent exploration.

This writing page is meant to be that outlet: a space to investigate small-scale scientific questions, offer practical tools, stay connected with other scientists, and highlight their work and perspectives along the way.

Thank you for visiting - I’m happy you’re here.
